The RLN circuit utilized in this project is sourced from the PSE Circom-RLN. It is highly recommended to opt for the audited circuit instead of constructing a custom RLN circuit, as this approach significantly mitigates security risks. However, it's essential to emphasize that every aspect of the code within this project should undergo a thorough audit to ensure comprehensive security and reliability.
